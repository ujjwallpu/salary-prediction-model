						Machine Learning Project: Salary Prediction using Linear Regression

								* Project Description


This project implements a simple Linear Regression model to predict the salary of employees based on their years of experience. The goal of the model is to establish a relationship between the two variables and predict an employee's salary given their years of experience.


* Tools Used: 

R, ggplot2, Linear Regression

* Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains two columns:

Years of Experience - The number of years an employee has worked.
Salary - The salary of the employee corresponding to their years of experience.


* Key Skills: 

Data cleaning, regression modeling, predictions, and data visualization.

* Results

# The model was able to predict the salary with a high degree of accuracy.

# Visualized the regression line and the data points on a plot for both training data and test data.
